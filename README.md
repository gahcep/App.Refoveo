Auto-Update Framework for Windows platform written in C#.

Ideas behind the project
========================

The initial idea was to develop 
> **robust**, **resilient** and **feature-reached** framework 

for Windows platform.

Originally such a request came from the requirement list of closed and proprietary solution in the company I'm working in.
At that moment, after a few days of investigating which solutions exist, it turned out that neither one provides all the features we need and required level of robustness.
 
One of the main requirement was the **robustness**, so in order to use existing solutions we would have had to add a lot of features and refactored the code. That was inaccessible and we agreed on the opinion of creating such a framework from the scratch. And I was the only person who started developing and by the time this file is being written, the company has the project almost done.

> **You may ask, why then I created the repository and want to rewrite the software.** 

Well, the project that is going to be written will be **completely different** from the one that already works (and is actively being developed). It will use all the ideas that 
either weren't accepted due to time limitations or weren't known at that time (I came up with them only now). Another good reason for the project - I have completely new **vision** of how things must be implemented.
